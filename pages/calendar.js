 * The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with CSS Grid layouts.
 * We do not need to implement a fully functional calendar, but given a list of days, the idea is to
 * create a grid that looks like a calendar. We could use something like Luxon later to plug in real
 * data, and even make it so the user can navigate the months, but that is not the main goal.
